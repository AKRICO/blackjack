BLACKJACK GAME 
(courtesy of Per Harald Borgen, CEO of Scrimba)

I followed Per's JavaScript course that includes this blackjack game. 
This blackjack game uses Arrays and Math object to generate random cards, as well as conditionals to change the value of Ace/1 to 11 and 11-13 as Jack/Queen/King to a value of 10. 


This game is great to practice getting used to manipulating the DOM by getting document via Id. It also includes If Else statements, for loops, and logical && operator. 

To sumarize, this game will practice the following principles: 
    - Array
    - Objects
    - Booleans
    - if else statements
    - comparison operator (<, >, ===)
    - logical (and && /or ||) operators
    - for loops
    - Math object (Math.random, Math.floor)
    - return statements

I will style the game once I have enough knowledge in styling with css. 

I would also like to learn how to get user input and then print it on screen beside the chips, and make it so the chips decreases as player draw cards.
